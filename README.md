# Hypothesis Test and Correlation Analysis: Rental-Subsidy-Rate-across-PHC-in-BC

The lack of affordable housing is a major challenge faced by British Columbians. 

In this assignement, I will focus on examining the data at the “regional” level of Provincial Health Authority (PHA; Fraser, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Coastal, & Vancouver Island)using data for BC from the 2016 Census, which is available from the BC data catalogue (https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public), to address the following research questions:

i. Do rental subsidization rates differ across regions of the Province (i.e. PHAs)?

ii. Are the rental subsidization rates correlated to socioeconomic factors?
