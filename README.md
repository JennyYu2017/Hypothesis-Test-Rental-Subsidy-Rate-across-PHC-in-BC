# Hypothesis-Test-Rental-Subsidy-Rate-across-PHC-in-BC

The lack of affordable housing is a major challenge faced by British Columbians.For the purposes of this assignment, we will focus on examining the data at the “regional” level of Provincial Health Authority (PHA; Fraser, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Coastal, & Vancouver Island).
Specifically, you’ve been asked to use data for BC from the 2016 Census, which is available from the BC data catalogue (https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public), to address the following research questions:
i. Do rental subsidization rates differ across regions of the Province (i.e. PHAs)?
ii. Are the rental subsidization rates of each region appropriate, after considering socioeconomic factors (as directed below), and if not, how should they be adjusted?
